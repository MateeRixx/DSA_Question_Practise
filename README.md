📚 Learning_DSA

The 3rd Year DSA & Coding Journey

Welcome to the Learning_DSA_3rdYear repository!

This repository serves as a dedicated space to meticulously track and organize my progress in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and competitive programming, primarily by solving problems on LeetCode.

The dual goals of this project are:

DSA Mastery: Build a strong, comprehensive foundation in core algorithms and data structures.

Git/GitHub Proficiency: Solidify a professional Git workflow by practicing version control, committing, branching, and repository management with every solution.

🎯 Technologies & Focus Areas

Focus Area

Primary Tool/Platform

Language

Data Structures

Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Trees, Graphs, Tries, Heaps

Python / C++

Algorithms

Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy, Backtracking

LeetCode

Version Control

Branching, Committing, Merging, Pull Requests

Git / GitHub

📂 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized primarily by the major Data Structure or Algorithm involved, making it easy to review topics.

Each directory contains the problem solutions, and often, brief explanations or complexity analysis in a file named NOTES.md.

⚙️ Git Workflow for Learning

For every new problem, the following workflow is followed to ensure consistent practice in Git:

Checkout: Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/LC-[Problem_ID]

Solve: Write the solution and tests.

Commit: git commit -m "feat(LC-[Problem_ID]): Solved [Problem Title] using [DSA Topic]"

Push: Push the branch to GitHub.

Merge: Merge the solution back into the main branch.

This practice is key to developing strong habits for team collaboration and project management later on.
